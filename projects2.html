                <h2>Wild Dog</h2>
                This project came into fruition as i was looking into the topics of animals. I wanted to break from my previous style. I decided to adopt an urelasitic style apporach to draw the dog, in which led me to develop a wacky design element. </div>

                <h2>Pinnochio</h2>
                THe idea of the Pinnochio concept was to use the layers to the best of my advantage. The layers allowed to have 2 separate images and using opacity to reduce one, to create an effect. The effect I had in mind was to make it seems as Pinnochio was hiding the background. </div>

                <h2>Python</h2>
                The latest project I'm working on right now, is to learn more of the python programme language to create my own game. One of my hobbies include gaming, and while doing some reseacrch its been made known that there's been a develppment growth on game engines that uses the python language. My aim is to increase my python knowledge and create a rpg game.</div>
